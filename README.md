# Benchmarking of TinyJAMBU Algorithm

## Overview

The benchmarking process involves running a shell script, `build.sh`, through the NIST framework on a signboard using PlatformIO. The script automates the benchmarking process and saves the results to the outputs folder.

## Shell Script

The `build.sh` shell script contains a sequence of shell commands and is executed through the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) terminal on Windows operating systems.

## Benchmarking Process

The benchmarking process includes Known Response Tests (KAT) and Size experiments. KAT results are stored in the `kat` subdirectory, while size experiments categorize results into both encryption-only and decryption-only scenarios, organizing relevant data into tables.

## Data Extraction

Data extracted includes RAM usage, Flash memory usage, execution time, encryption time, and decryption time. Extracted data is organized into tables for later analysis.

## Visualization Tool

A Python script, adapted from the author's semester 1 Bachelor Semester Project (BSP), is used to develop a visualization tool. The script utilizes Tkinter to create a graphical interface for visualizing benchmarking results stored in CSV files. This tool facilitates the comparison of performance metrics between different optimization indicators.


The primary goal is to assess the impact of modifications on algorithm behavior. The research project associated with this repository provides valuable insights into the dynamic performance of cryptographic algorithms in resource-constrained environments.
